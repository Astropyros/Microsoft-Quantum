        "# Integrated Hybrid: Blending classical and quantum computing\n",
        "In this sample, you will discover how to blend classical and quantum instructions in the same program, all fully processed by the quantum computing back-end.\n",

        "\n",
        "This program will examine a 3 qubit Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) state and counts the number of times it sees the entanglement fail out of 10 attempts. Unlike in perfect, noiseless simulations, entanglement failures can occur in real-world runs, which are subject to the effects of noise.\n",
